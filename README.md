# Transient-Response-in-C
A program that calculates and plots transient response of three reactors over time based on user inputted values. It then saves the data in a binary file.

This was the final project in my GNG 1106 Computation course at University of Ottawa During Fall Semester of 2018
This project is a program relevant in the field of Chemical Engineering
